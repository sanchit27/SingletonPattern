# SingletonPattern
This repository demonstrates the Singleton Pattern with a simple Pizza Logger example in Java.

# Introduction
The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when you need to coordinate actions across a system, and you want to ensure that there is only one object that can perform those actions.

# Pizza Logger Example
In this example, we have a PizzaLogger class that is used to log pizza orders. Since we want to ensure that there is only one logger object, we implement the Singleton Pattern.

The PizzaLogger class has a private constructor and a static method getInstance() that returns the single instance of the class. This ensures that no other objects can create new instances of the class. We also make the class thread-safe by using the synchronized keyword in the getInstance() method.

To use the PizzaLogger, we simply call the getInstance() method to get the single instance, and then call the log() method to log the pizza order.

# Conclusion
The Singleton Pattern is a useful design pattern when you need to ensure that there is only one instance of a class, and that it is globally accessible. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as logging, configuration settings, and database connections.

In this example, we saw how the Singleton Pattern can be used to ensure that there is only one PizzaLogger object, which can be used to log pizza orders. You can use this pattern in your own code to ensure that certain objects are only instantiated once, and that they are accessible from anywhere in the codebase.
